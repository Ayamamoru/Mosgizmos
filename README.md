Athena qs
What is your project?
- This is Mosgizmos and uh basically I wanted to have a place to make lil features without potentially breaking my site by straight up jamming them in there... Currently, it's just a simple music player!

Why did you make your project?
- I wanted to test an idea (wow, a success!) so I can hopefully replicate a smaller version of it on my personal website!

How you made your project
- I used github codespaces, html, js and css! 

Struggles? What did you learn?
- I learned that booleans are kinda hard and that typos can mess up a lot of things... figures that coding while sleep deprived creates typos which makes bugs.
